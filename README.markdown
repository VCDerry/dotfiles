Personal config files.  Vim and Emacs directories contain a mix of code I wrote
and code I downloaded.  Don't just download these files and use them, crap will
break.  Read them and adapt them if you think it's worth it.  Enjoy.

All Vim/Emacs code I wrote myself is released into the public domain.
